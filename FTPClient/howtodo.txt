This is the guide how to build the project using the script:
1. Launch the console
2. Check if you have cmake installed
	cmake --version
IF NOT INSTALLED:
2.1 Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.
2.2 Install CMake by running the following command:
	sudo apt-get install cmake
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is placed from the console
4. Make the script file executable by running the following command:
	chmod +x build_script.sh
5. Run the script by executing the script file with the following command:
	./build_script.sh
This will start executing the commands in the script one by one.
6. Monitor the terminal output for any errors or progress messages. The script will perform the CMake configuration, build the project, clean files, and create a tar.gz archive as specified in the script.
7. Once the script execution is complete, you can check the specified destination directory for the built executable file and the tar.gz archive.
