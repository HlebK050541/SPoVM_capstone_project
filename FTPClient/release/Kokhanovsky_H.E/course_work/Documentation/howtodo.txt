Building the FTP Client Project

This guide provides instructions on how to build the FTP Client project using the provided Makefile. Follow the steps below to compile the project successfully.


Step 1: Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

    GNU Make
    GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Step 2: Download the Project
Download the project source code to your local machine.

Step 3: Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

    ftp-client.c: The main source code file of the FTP Client.
    Makefile: The Makefile that automates the build process.
    Documentation/: A directory containing additional documentation files.

Step 4: Building the Project
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

    To build the project in release mode, run the following command:

	make release

    To build the project in debug mode, run the following command:

	make debug

Step 5: Output
After a successful build, the compiled binary will be generated in either the release/ or debug/ directory, depending on the build mode you chose.

Step 6: Creating an Archive
To create a compressed archive of the project, including the source code and documentation, run the following command:

	make tar

The archive will be created with the name 050541_Kokhanovsky_H.E._Capstone_Project.tar.gz.

Step 7: Cleaning
To clean the generated build files and the archive, run the following command:

	make clean

This will remove the release/, debug/, and 050541_Kokhanovsky_H.E._Capstone_Project.tar.gz files/directories.
